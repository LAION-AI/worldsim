# Worldsim - Interactive agents are simulacra for human cognitions

WorldSim is an innovative simulation project designed to simulate character behaviors, emotions, cognitions, and social interactions, all alongside dynamic world events and processes. Framed as a creative writing game for state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 and LLAMA V2 70B, it mirrors intricate real-world scenarios in a structured virtual setting. By creating "timestep objects" and "character description objects," it captures discrete events and character nuances, bringing depth to the simulated world. Its scientific value is manifold, offering a sandbox to study complex systems, emergent phenomena, and human-like AI behaviors. Moreover, WorldSim's potential is vast for creative fields; it can serve as a robust tool for authors and screenwriters, inspiring unique narratives, and offering a fresh perspective on character developments. In the gaming sector, WorldSim could revolutionize NPC simulations, providing more realistic and layered AI-driven characters. For developers, the project opens avenues to explore implementing Vector Databases, Memory and Event retrieval, and Semantic net traversal. Plus, there are opportunities to visualize characters and events with SDLX and fine-tune for consistent character, object, and location representations using dreambooth, textual inversion, and similar technologies. We invite programmers and enthusiasts to join this groundbreaking endeavor and help shape the future of virtual simulations.
